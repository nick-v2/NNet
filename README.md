# NNet

A lightweight, powerful tool for making neural networks. I have only ever tested it with video games but it might have use with other applications. This project allowed me to learn the ins and outs of a neural network. I try to update this tool regularly with new settings so more advanced networks can be created.

### The rest of the README will be updated at a later date (There is a lot I want to add)
